## Web Service Standards
The following the patterns defined below describes the expectations that should be available in every web service (WS) as a rule. All developers utilizing this WS API should be able to rely on the consistency of implementation. All developers implementing a web service in this API should know these patterns an adhere to them strictly. Should a situation appear that is outside of these patterns and rules, then it should be reviewed by the team and updated within this document with the clearly communicated understanding that everyone is to follow the revised patterns and rules.

## Definitions

#### Web Service Provider (aka Provider)
The provider of web services to an audience of web service consumers. A provider provides web services for consumption.

#### Web Service Consumer (aka Consumer)
The consumer of web services made available by a web service provider. A consumers consumes web services to push and pull data. 


## RESTful URLs
There are [many articles](https://www.google.com/#q=restful+url+design) and [REST specifications](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm) online that can educate on the basics. This API follows a few key points:

1. Structure the URL from the **consumer's** perspective and be consistent!
2. Endpoint names are plural nouns 
  * /users - returns a list of users
  * /tickets - returns a list of tickets
3. Get single objects by adding the object "id" after the plural noun endpoint name
  * /users/1 - retrieves user with id=1
  * /orders/2 - retrieves order with id=2
4. Use [HTTP Request Methods](#http-request-methods) to do different actions with a single plural noun endpoint
  * /users/1 POST - create a new user
  * /users/1 GET - retrieve user id=1
  * /users/1 PUT - update user id=1
  * /users/1 DELETE - delete user id=1
5. Relational requests extend the parent endpoint
  * /users/1/roles - returns the roles associated with user id=1
  * /users/1/roles/2 - returns role with id=2 for user with id=1
6. Use "verb" endpoint names only when it makes better sense from the consumer's perspective
  * /search - invokes a global search perhaps
  * /users/1/star - adds a star to the user's profile
  * NOTE: Optionally consider to embed the "action" within a plural noun resource like "/users/1" PATCH with body parameter "isStarred: true". In some cases this might lead to a more intuitive API with fewer "action" endpoints to be concerned about.

## Request Methods

#### GET
Requests one or more objects from the database. Optionally includes a request parameter on the URL string for the "id" of the 
specific object to retrieve. For example, "/users" to retrieve a list of users and "/users/1" to retrieve user with id=1.

#### POST
Inserts a new object into the database. For example, "/users" to post a new user object to the database.

#### PUT
Updates the entire object into the database. A PUT assumes that the request will contain all necessary fields to completely 
replace the object within the database. For example, "/users/1" to update an existing user within the database.

#### PATCH
Partially updates an object within the database. The purpose of PATCH is to send only the data that should be changed about an object while keeping everything else unchanged. As of this writing, PATCH will not be used very often, if at all. 

#### DELETE
Requests the deletion of a specific object. For example, "/users/1" to delete user with id=1 from the database.


## Versioning
Versioning the API ensures backward compatability with consumers and allows the developers of the API to release new versions of a web services API without impacting existing consumers (unless they choose to be impacted). Where to place the version number value within the request is an [ongoing debate](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/389169/best-practices-for-api-versioning). The approach taken by this API follows [Vinay Sahni](http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api#versioning), which is to include the MAJOR version number of the API in the URI and optionally include a minor version value of the API within the URL or a custom HTTP header attribute titled "API-Version".

```
curl https://api.[your-hostname].com/v1/users
```

```
curl https://api.[your-hostname].com/v1.1/users
```

```
curl https://api.[your-hostname].com/v1/users -H "API-Version: 2016-11-06"
```

### Incrementing Versions
Versioning should be viewed from the perspective of the consumer. Incrementing a version number communicates to a consumer that new features are available. If changes are made to the API that do not affect the API schema, then perhaps there is no need to increment the version. For example, if a bug is fixed on version 1.1 that doesn't require a change to the request or response schema, then do not update the API URL version. In this situation, the development team might increment a build number to properly identify the version of the software code that was deployed. 

> NOTE: Versioning is never done at the individual endpoint level as that would create an unmanagable tangle of version numbers that would be difficult for a consumer to follow. For example, /v1/users/1/v3/roles/1/v9/claims. This tells a story of API version 1 with /users version 1 and /roles version 3 that is calling into /claims v9. 

### Major Versions
A major version is located within the URL with an optional sub-version number. Incrementing a major version number is a subjective process to be defined by the development and/or marketing team(s). In general, increment the major version number by 1 when the API changes require consumers to refactor their applications to conform to the new specifications. 

API Version 1 - Initial version with no defined sub-version number.
```
curl https://api.[your-hostname].com/v1/users
```

API Version 2 - Version 2 of the API with no defined sub-version number
```
curl https://api.[your-hostname].com/v2/users
```

### Minor Versions
A minor version can be located in either the URL after the major version (ie v1.1) or in the HTTP request header in an attribute titled "API-Version". The use of the minor version is optional and a decision of the business and/or development team(s). In general, increment the minor version number by 1 when backward compatible API changes have been made in the current major version, but the consumer will be required to make minor updates or changes to utilize the new features. 

In most cases, it's wise to increment the version number even for small changes in the request or response. Hopefully the consumers of the services haven't written their code in a such a way that a new element returned in a response would break their app. Since most web service providers work to achieve a highly stable platform, it's best to assume that the consumers will have low quality adapters that break easily and to increment minor versions whenever the request/response schemas change. 

The minor version value strategy when embedding the value in the URL is to use integers. When applying the minor version within the HTTP header, then it is recommended to use a date in the format of "YYYY-MM-DD". The date chosen should be any date after the last minor version date. 

The Major Version number combined with the Minor Version number defines a specific API schema at a point in time. 

API Version 1.1 - Initial version with specific minor version in the URL
```
curl https://api.[your-hostname].com/v1.1/users
```

API Version 1.2016-11-6 - Initial version with specific minor version "2016-11-6" in the header
```
curl https://api.[your-hostname].com/v1/users -H "API-Version: 2016-11-06"
```

API Version 2.2 - Version 2 of the API with specific minor version in the URL
```
curl https://api.[your-hostname].com/v2.1/users
```

API Version 2.2016-11-6 - Version 2 of the API with specific minor version "2016-12-6" in the header
```
curl https://api.[your-hostname].com/v2/users -H "API-Version: 2016-12-06"
```

> NOTE: As of this writing (11/24/2016) the only supported minor version technique is to use the URL. Header versioning has not yet been implemented.

## Filtering, Sorting, Searching, Selecting Fields
The following common actions use query parameters to add provide the web service with options for processing the request and how to return the data in the response.  
```
/v1/users?sort=-name
```
> NOTE: Query parameters should not be embedded into the RESTful URL. DON'T do "/v1/users/sort/-name"!

> INFO: Be sure to document all query parameters so that the consumer has a clear definition of how to use the web service API

#### Filters
Add customer query parameters for each filter the consumer is able to manipulate. For example, to filter a list of users to only those that are active and have roles:
```
/v1/users?status=active&hasRoles=true
```

#### Sorting
Sorting a list of results from a resource call should follow a standard protocol:

```
/v1/users?sort=lastName,firstName,-active
```

* "sort" query parameter holds the sorting details
* Include one or more object property names separated by commas like "?sort=lastName,firstName,-active"
  * The sort order will be performed in the order that the names are specified. 
* Specify "descending sort" for a object property by prefixing the object property with a minus sign (ie "-lastName")
* Specify "ascending sort" for an object property by having no prefix to the object property name.

#### Searching
Searching within a resource should follow the standard protocol:

```
/v1/users?q=hello
```

* "q" query parameter holds the search details
* Include an appropriate value supported by the web service for searching like "hello" to full-text search for the word "hello"

#### Selecting Fields
Web services working with large data sets, large objects, or object associations may wish to allow the consumer to control the data returned in the response. The following protocol should be followed in these situations.

Returns the default set of data for a list of users:
```
/v1/users
```

Returns the default set of data for a list of users as well as the "roles" associated object for each user record:
```
/v1/users?select=default,roles
```

Returns only the "firstName", "lastName", "email", and "phones" data within the list of users:
```
/v1/users?select=firstName,lastName,email,phones
```

> NOTE: These "select" options are unique to each web service and must be documented clearly to the consumer. 


## Response Status Codes
The following codes are returned as HTTP Status Codes in the response header depending on the circumstances described below. All responses regardless of the status code, should contain a well formed JSON response object that contains meaningful information for the consumer.

#### 200 OK
Returned for an expected and acceptable web service request from a consumer. This status code is expected to have a response body for the consumer. If no response body is needed, then use the 204 No Content response status code. 

#### 201 Created
Returned after a POST request successfully creates a new resource. The location (URL) of the newly created resource should be defined within the "Location" HTTP Header attribute within the response. See [Location Header](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.30) in the HTTP spec. 

#### 204 No Content
Returned when the request completed successfully but has no response content to return. This response status code should be used in response to a DELETE request. When a DELETE is successful, there isn't anything to return other than "success", which is sufficiently communicated via the 204 No Content response status code. 

#### 400 Bad Request
Returned when the request parameters are incorrect, invalid, or incomplete. This response status code should be use to enforce the schema of the request. 

#### 401 Unauthorized
Returned when a consumer makes a request to a web service that is secured and the consumer is not authorized to make the request. 

#### 402 Request Failed
Returned when an expected failure situation occurrs, such as a parameter has an incorrect format or value. Other reasons for returning this status code might be a failure to properly complete a transaction. In every case, the response should include a detailed explaination to the consumer as to the error code, description, and any other information they should have to retry. 

#### 403 Forbidden
Returned when a consumer is authorized (i.e. logged in) and makes a request to a secured web service but the consumer doesn't have the proper authorization to make the request. 

#### 404 Not Found
Returned when a request is made for specific data, usually using an ID, and the data cannot be found. This response code is also returned automatically by the web server if a endpoint or URL is not defined by the application. 

#### 500 Internal Server Error
Returned when an unexpected error occurs within the app for any reason. This is usually accompanied by an application stack trace.


## Response Body
Every HTTP Response should contain a well defined HEADER and BODY so that the consumer has a well formed and _meaningful_ response message. Consumers of web services can be frustrated during development or while debugging a production issue if the web service response is not informative enough as to the reasons for success, partial success, or failure of a request. 

### HTTP GET
1. 200 "OK" HTTP Response Status Code should be returned IF the request is successfully processed. See [Response Status Codes](#response-status-code) for other behaviors.
2. Response body should contain the data requested by the GET request.
3. Errors should follow the [Response Errors](#response-errors) pattern

### HTTP POST
1. 201 "Created" HTTP Response Status Code should be returned IF the request is successfully processed. See [Response Status Codes](#response-status-code) for other behaviors.
2. HTTP header attribute "Location" should contain the URL to the newly created resource http://api.[your-hostname].com/v1/users/35
3. Response body should return the full record in JSON format (so that the consumer doesn't have to immediately refetch)
4. Errors should follow the [Response Errors](#response-errors) pattern

### HTTP PUT or PATCH
1. 200 "OK" HTTP Response Status Code should be returned IF the request is successfully processed. See [Response Status Codes](#response-status-code) for other behaviors.
2. Response body should return the full record in JSON format (so that the consumer doesn't have to immediately refetch)
3. Errors should follow the [Response Errors](#response-errors) pattern

### Response Errors
When any error occurs within the app, like a required field, format error, or an exception it is necessary to communicate back to the consumer the errors that occured in a standard format. According to the HTTP specification, when returning a 400 or 500 range response status code that an explaination of some sort should be included within the body of the response (ie Text, JSON, XML, ...). 

A web services API should have one pattern for returning errors so that the consumers can reliably expect to find the error information in a consistent location and structure. 

__HTTP 400s - Expected__
```
[
   {error: "unique.code.here", errorDescription: "human readable description"},
   {error: "unique.code.here", errorDescription: "human readable description"},
]
```
* code (text, required): a human readable code that uniquely identifies the expected error. This code can also be used as a unique key to look up a language translation (i18n) within the consumer app.
* description (text, required): any human readable text describing the error. Useful for testers, developers, or anyone reading the response.

Example: PUT request to /users/1 resulted in a HTTP 402 Request Failed due to invalid data. 
```
[
   {error: "param.invalid.email", errorDescription: "`email` is not formatted correctly. ex: text@text.ext"},
   {error: "param.invalid.phone", errorDescription: "`phone` is not formatted correctly. ex: 123-123-1233"},
   {error: "param.required.email", errorDescription: "`email` is a required field"},
   {error: "param.required.first-name", errorDescription: "`firstName` is a required field"}
]
```

__HTTP 500s - Unexpected__
```
[
   {error: "error.unexpected", errorDescription: "any text or app stacktrace"},
   {error: "error.unexpected", errorDescription: "any text or app stacktrace"}
]
```
* code (text, required): Any code can be used, but it is likely that only "error.unexpected" would be used since the very nature of 500 errors are unexpected and unknown. 
* description (text, required): Very likely the stack trace from the exception thrown by the app, although any text describing the error can be included in this place. 

Example: PUT request to /users/1 resulted in a HTTP 500 response with a stack trace
```
[
   {error: "500_internal_server_error", errorDescription: "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
        at com.example.myproject.Book.getTitle(Book.java:16)
        at com.example.myproject.Author.getBookTitles(Author.java:25)
        at com.example.myproject.Bootstrap.main(Bootstrap.java:14)"}
]
```

## Examples

#### /v1/users - GET
Returns a list of users that the consumer is eligible to receive.

#### /v1/users?select=Roles - GET
Follows the same process as /users - GET, but additionally returns the associated Roles of the User (this follows OData spec). Consult the web services API Doc documentation for options on the additional information that the web service supports in the response. 

#### /v1/users/1 - GET
Returns a specific User with "id" of 1. Returns a 404 response code if no user is found. 

#### /v1/users - POST
Creates a new user record. Returns a 201 "Created" HTTP response code if the user is successfully created along with a Location header with the URL to the new record (ie Location: /v1/users/2). 

#### /v1/users/1 - PUT
Updates an existing user record by overwriting the object in the database with the given request payload. If data is omitted from the request payload, then it will be deleted in the database. PUT represents a complete overwrite, whereas PATCH represents a partial update.

#### /v1/users/1 - DELETE
Deletes a specific User with "id" of 1

#### /v1/users/1/roles - GET
Returns a list of roles that the consumer is eligible to receive. This is an example of nesting associated objects of the User in a RESTful pattern. 

#### /v1/users/1/roles/2 - GET
Returns a specific User Role from User id=1 and Role id = 2.

#### /v1/users/1/roles - POST
Creates a new role for User with "id" = 1. Returns a 201 "Created" HTTP response code if the role is successfully created along with a Location header with the URL to the new record (ie Location: /v1/users/1/roles/2).

#### /v1/users/1/roles/2 - PUT
Updates an existing role record (id=2) for existing user record (id=1) by overwriting the object in the database with the given request payload. If data is omitted from the request payload, then it will be deleted in the database. PUT represents a complete overwrite, whereas PATCH represents a partial update.

#### /v1/users/1/roles/2 - DELETE
Deletes a specific user role with id="2" for user with id = "1".

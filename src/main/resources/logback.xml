         The issue is that Tomcat JAR scanner cannot find the dependencies of the ESAPI.jar because
         Gradle/Maven screened them out since they were already referenced by other other .jar files.

         This issue does not occur when a WAR file is built since the /lib folder contains the single
         set of JARs and the Tomcat JAR scanner doesn't have additional information about versions, etc.
